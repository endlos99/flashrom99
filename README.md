FlashROM 99
===========

The *TI 99/4A Flash ROM Cartridge*, or FlashROM 99 for short, is a cartridge
for the TI 99/4A home computer that allows for running ROM cartridge images
stored on an SD card.

![The FlashROM 99 Cartridge](/doc/flashrom99.jpg)

The FlashROM 99 supports ROM-only images of up to 32K that use the
write-to-`>60xx` bank switching scheme.  It will not work with programs
using GROMs or CRU-based bank switching.  The cartridge does not require the
Peripheral Expansion Box and runs on both PAL and NTSC consoles.

The project homepage is hosted at [GitHub][1].

FlashROM 99 is released as Open Source Hardware under the
[CERN OHL license][4] and the [GNU GPL license][5].  Both hardware design
files and firmware sources are available on [GitHub][2].


Using the FlashROM 99
---------------------

Using the FlashROM 99 is simple and doesn't require and special hardware or
software.

To begin, copy up to 171 cartridge image files onto an SD or SDHC card.
Switch off the TI 99 and plug in the FlashROM 99, then insert the SD card
into the FlashROM 99.  Switch on the TI 99 and wait until the activity
indicator on the FlashROM 99 is no longer lit.

Press any key to bring up the TI menu screen.  You should see the list of
images found on the SD card.  If the SD card contains more than 8 images, a
`FLASHROM 99` entry is shown instead.  Selecting this entry starts an image
browser where you can page through the list of available images with `,`,
`.`, `SPACE`, and number keys.

![Image selection](/doc/selection.png)

Select the image you want to run.  The screen will show a loader animation
while the image loads.  Once the image has been loaded, it will run
automatically.  The SD card is now no longer required and may be removed.

If only one image is found on the SD card, it is loaded immediately without
the need to select it first.

If you want to run a different program from the SD card, reset the TI 99 by
pressing `FCTN-=` and then reset the FlashROM 99 by pushing the reset
button.  If you do not reset the FlashROM 99, the TI menu will show only the
previously selected image.  Alternatively, you can power cycle the console,
which will reset both TI 99 and FlashROM 99.

For detailed usage information please refer to the [FlashROM 99 homepage][1].


Building the FlashROM 99
------------------------

The [GitHub repository][2] contains all hardware design files and software
sources required to build the FlashROM 99.


### Hardware

To assemble the FlashROM 99 you need the following components:

- 1x FlashROM 99 board
- 1x ATmega 8515 (either 8515-16 or 8515L-8)
- 1x 62256 32K SRAM (any speed rating)
- 1x 74HCT377 (LS may also work, but untested)
- 3x 74HCT541 (LS may also work, but untested)
- 6x 100 nF capacitors (e.g., multi-layer ceramic X7R, no electrolytic!)
- 1x 68 Ohm resistor
- 1x 330-470 Ohm resistor (depending on LED used, smaller values will be
     brighter)
- 1x 10 kOhm resistor
- 1x LED (e.g., 5 mm red or yellow)
- 1x micro push button
- 1x SD card module

The FlashROM 99 board was designed with [KiCad][6], a cross platform and
open source electronics design automation suite.  The design files are
stored in `pcb/`.

To simplify the board layout, the design uses an inexpensive SD module that
is readily available online.  Searching for `SD card Arduino` should give
you plenty of hits, including Amazon, ebay, and Pollin.  Make sure to pick a
module that matches the pin-out of the reference module shown below. Note
that the 3.3V input is not used, so any substitutes must be powered by 5V.

You can use any kind of single color LED, but you may have to adjust the 470
Ohm resistor if you choose anything other than red or yellow.

The push button is used to reset the board and will be pushed frequently.
You might choose an angled button if you prefer to push horizontally instead
of vertically.  This will also put less stress on the cart connector.

If the board shows connectors for a 1 nF capacitor next to the 377, do *not*
put this capacitor there, but leave the connectors empty.

When assembling the board make sure to place all ICs properly oriented --
some ICs are upside down!  On the board, the location of pin 1 is indicated
by a small line in the IC outline.  Socketing the ATmega allows for future
software updates.  It is best not to socket the 541s, however, as this will
make inserting the assembled cart into the TI 99 more difficult.

![Parts Placement](/doc/placement.jpg)

The push button is best soldered to the top of the board so that the bottom
area remains as smooth as possible.  After the button is soldered, put some
insulating tape on its bottom contacts to avoid interference with the SD
module.

![Assembly](/doc/assembly.jpg)

Insert the SD module from the bottom and solder either one row of connectors
top so that the metal part of the module is flush with the board.  Some SD
modules have a crooked connector, though, so that a small gap may remain.

If you don't want to build the board yourself feel free to contact the
developer for available sources.


#### Previous Versions

Early versions of the FlashROM 99 used an additional 1 nF capacitor that
resulted in unreliable disk access on some, but not all systems with certain
disk controllers.

Please check to see if the 1 nF capacitor is present on your board.  If so,
simply remove it by desoldering or clipping its wires to improve the
stability of your cart.

If you applied a so-called "disk fix" to your board in the past, you don't
need to undo those changes when removing the capacitor.


### Software

The software for the ATmega 8515 consists of two components.  The `avr/`
folder contains the microcontroller logic for accessing the SD card, filling
the SRAM chip, and controlling the TI bus.

The `ti/` folder contains TI 99 assembly sources for the image menu and the
image browser.  The assembled TMS 9900 machine code is embedded in the
microcontroller code and loaded into RAM during operation.

To build the software, you first need to assemble the menu and browser
program with [`xas99`][3] and convert the generated machine code into C
code:

	$ cd ti/
	$ xas99.py -b -R -I <xdt99>/lib menu.a99
	$ mkmenu.py

Now you can compile the microcontroller code in `avr/`.  The folder contains
a `Makefile` for `avr-gcc` that will make compilation trivial.

	$ cd avr/
	$ make

As an option, you can enable multi-file functionality in the `Makefile`.
This feature, however, will severely extend the scan time for SD cards with
many images.  Only enable multi-file if you plan to use the FlashROM 99 with
no more than about two dozenzs of images per SD card.  To compile with
multi-file, you may have to disable FAT16 support in `avr/lib/pffconf.h` in
case the executable gets too large.

The build yields a `.hex` file that you can flash to the ATmega 8515 using
[`avrdude`][7] or your programmer of choice:

	$ avrdude -p atmega8515 -P /dev/ttyACM0 -c stk500 -U flash:w:flashrom99.hex

Additionally, you need to program the lower fuse bits of the 8515 so that it
runs at 8 MHz:

	$ avrdude -p atmega8515 -P /dev/ttyACM0 -c stk500 -U lfuse:w:0xe4:m

If you're using a different tool chain make sure to set `CKSEL3..0` in the
lower fuse byte to `0100`.  (Note that `0` means "programmed", and `1` means
"unprogrammed").  You can verfify that you're running at the right clock
speed by resetting the FlashROM 99 with no SD card inserted: The LED should
blink about once per second.

Finally, make sure that the bootloader is disabled by checking if higher
fuse bits `BOOTSZ1`, `BOOTSZ0`, and `BOOTRSET` are all set to `1`.  This
should be the default for new 8515s.

In the end, the lower and higher fuse bytes should have values `E4` and
`D9`, respectively.


About the Project
-----------------

The TI 99/4A Flash ROM Cartridge is Open Source Hardware released under the
[CERN OHL license][4], in the hope that TI 99 enthusiasts may find it useful.
Software components are released under the [GNU GPL license][5].

The hardware was designed with the open source electronics design automation
suite [KiCad][6].  The microcontroller code uses a modified version of the
[Petit FatFs][8] library.  Thanks go to Jon Guidry (acadiel) of `hexbus.com`
for designing the original bank switching circuitry for the first TI
multi-carts.
